                  It's made to be simple enough to be used by friends and family who just want to compete in a social way, and professional enough to be used by sports venues.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>Suitable playing time for this schedule is 2 hours, which means that the breaks are not too long and the matches are not too short, but the total playing time can be shortened if you want.
                    Absolutely the best AW activity and of course everyday gaming.</p><br>
                <p>At present, the schedule supports 1 course with 4-6 players. 		                 
                  New schedules and updates are likely to come in the future.</p>
