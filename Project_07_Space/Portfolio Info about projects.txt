Hi! 

In case the portfolio danheikenberg.com is not working, info and links to the individual projects are further down in this document.

I´m a creative soul who loves problem solving, new technologies and challenges almost as much as I love coffee and cookies.
On my spare time I make websites, paint, write music, and make games (both digital and physical card games).

I work in a factory, but even though I try to fill upp my spare time with lots of creative projects,
I still find myself bored at work, and so I finally decided to make a portfolio so that I could start searching for my future job.

Hopefully the diversity of the portfolio shows a potential side of me that might be useful for your company, that
I truly love the creative and explorative side of this world.

More about me, I love mario kart, ping pong, and karaoke. I jog/gym to try to stay active.
I´m a licensed math teacher, but I´d like an even more creative job than that.

I´m movable, but can also work from home.

Thanks for giving me the time, and have a nice day!

//Dan Heikenberg

A website for searching and getting recorded bird sounds, and
simultaneously an image of that bird (altough not always the
correct subfamily).

Draug Tattoo
(HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP)
A website I made from scratch by request of a tatoo artist friend.
I first made a layout example, and he got to approve and add input along
the way. He painted the skull, and that inspired me to add
smoke and glowing eyes.
